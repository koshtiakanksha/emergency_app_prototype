# **Emergency Management App Prototype**  

### **Overview**  
The **Emergency Management App Prototype** is a real-time **crisis response system** built using **Streamlit, FastAPI, and Folium/Plotly**. It helps **first responders, volunteers, and emergency coordinators** efficiently **track incidents, manage responders, and send real-time notifications** based on geolocation data.  

**Live Demo:** [Emergency App on Streamlit](https://emergency-management-prototype.streamlit.app/)
